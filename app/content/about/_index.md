Hi, I'm Cl√©ment. I graduated from EPITA, a French computer science school. I'm currently a software engineer living in Paris, and I enjoy programming, server automation, chess, golf, piano, programming, and redundancy (I know, this joke has officially run its course...).

Feel free to browse my blog and some of my previous/ongoing projects!

You can always find my resume [here](https://thuault.com/resume.pdf).
